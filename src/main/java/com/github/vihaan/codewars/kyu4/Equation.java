/*
Create a function that differentiates a polynomial for a given value of x.

Your function will receive 2 arguments: a polynomial as a string, and a point to evaluate the equation as an integer.

Assumptions:
There will be a coefficient near each x, unless the coefficient equals 1 or -1.
There will be an exponent near each x, unless the exponent equals 0 or 1.
All exponents will be greater or equal to zero
Examples:
Equation.differenatiate("12x+2", 3)      ==>   12
Equation.differenatiate("x^2+3x+2", 3)   ==>   9
